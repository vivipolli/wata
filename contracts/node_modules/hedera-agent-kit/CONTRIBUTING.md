## 1. Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Clone** your fork:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/hedera-dev/hedera-agent-kit.git
```

3. Create a new branch for your work:

```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

5. Push your branch to GitHub and open a pull request (PR) against main.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

This project requires DCO sign-offs. When you commit, include a line in your commit message:

```bash
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

If you use the CLI, you can add the -s or --signoff flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Implement a new feature"
```

Make sure the name and email match the identity you’ve set in Git. GitHub Actions will verify DCO compliance on every PR. If you forget, you can amend your commit or force-push once you’ve added the sign-off line.

## 3. Code Style & Testing

1. Linting: This project uses ESLint. Run npm run lint to check for coding style issues.
2. Testing: Ensure all tests pass locally via npm run test.
3. Formatting: Use Prettier or your favorite formatter—just keep code consistent!
